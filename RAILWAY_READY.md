# 🚀 Railway-Ready CAGR API

## ✅ **Railway Deployment Configuration Complete!**

Your CAGR API is now fully configured for Railway deployment with Firefox-ESR support.

### 🔧 **Railway-Specific Files Created:**

1. **`railway_setup.sh`** - Installs Firefox-ESR and geckodriver on Railway
2. **`nixpacks.toml`** - Nixpacks configuration for Railway
3. **`railway.env`** - Environment variables for Railway
4. **`RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`** - Complete deployment guide

### 🎯 **Key Railway Optimizations:**

#### **Firefox-ESR Configuration:**
- ✅ **Binary Path**: `/usr/bin/firefox-esr` (Railway standard)
- ✅ **Geckodriver**: `/usr/local/bin/geckodriver` (system installed)
- ✅ **Headless Mode**: Always enabled for Railway
- ✅ **Memory Optimization**: Configured for Railway's limits

#### **Environment Detection:**
- ✅ **Linux Detection**: Automatically uses Firefox-ESR on Railway
- ✅ **Windows/macOS**: Falls back to webdriver-manager for local development
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: Configurable paths via Railway variables

#### **Railway Build Process:**
- ✅ **Setup Script**: `railway_setup.sh` installs Firefox-ESR
- ✅ **Dependencies**: All required Linux packages included
- ✅ **Geckodriver**: Downloaded and installed during build
- ✅ **Permissions**: Proper file permissions set

### 🚀 **Deployment Commands:**

```bash
# 1. Connect to Railway
railway login
railway init

# 2. Set environment variables
railway variables set AUTH_TOKEN=your_secret_token

# 3. Deploy
railway up
```

### 📊 **Railway-Specific Features:**

#### **Automatic Setup:**
- Firefox-ESR installation
- Geckodriver download and setup
- Required Linux dependencies
- Proper file permissions

#### **Environment Variables:**
- `FIREFOX_BINARY_PATH=/usr/bin/firefox-esr`
- `GECKODRIVER_PATH=/usr/local/bin/geckodriver`
- `AUTH_TOKEN=your_secret_token`
- `SCRAPING_FREQUENCY_HOURS=6`

#### **Health Monitoring:**
- Health endpoint: `/health`
- Manual scraping: `/scrape/manual`
- Data retrieval: `/data`
- Statistics: `/data/statistics`

### 🎯 **Railway Deployment Checklist:**

- [x] **Firefox-ESR Support** - Configured for Linux
- [x] **Geckodriver Setup** - System installation
- [x] **Environment Detection** - Linux/Windows compatibility
- [x] **Memory Optimization** - Railway-optimized settings
- [x] **Build Configuration** - Nixpacks setup
- [x] **Health Checks** - Railway health monitoring
- [x] **Environment Variables** - Configurable settings
- [x] **Error Handling** - Robust error management

### 🔍 **Testing on Railway:**

```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health

# Manual scrape
curl -X POST -H "X-Auth-Token: your_token" \
  https://your-app.railway.app/scrape/manual

# Get data
curl -H "X-Auth-Token: your_token" \
  https://your-app.railway.app/data
```

### 📝 **Important Notes:**

1. **Firefox-ESR** is more stable on Railway than Chrome
2. **System geckodriver** is preferred over webdriver-manager
3. **Headless mode** is required for Railway deployment
4. **Memory optimization** is crucial for Railway's limits
5. **Environment variables** provide flexibility

### 🎉 **Ready for Railway!**
